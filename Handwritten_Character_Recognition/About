This project aims to develop a robust system for recognizing handwritten characters. Using a dataset of handwritten letters, 
the model preprocesses input images and applies machine learning techniques to classify characters effectively. The implementation 
involves feature extraction methods and classifiers to achieve high accuracy in recognizing letters from images. The project demonstrates 
the potential of machine learning in solving real-world problems, particularly in automating the transcription of handwritten text
